# This is a major project of mine on using artificial intelligence for non-face emotion recognition.


I have noted the information about your repository. You mentioned using the dataset of "MANAS SAMBARE" from Kaggle for training, and the dataset can be found at this link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013). Additionally, you utilize the haarcascade for face detection. You have pre-built models and Python files for training and testing. You recommend using Google Colab for training and Anaconda on Windows for running the face detection application.

I apologize for the lack of detailed instructions for the facial emotion recognition part. It was a small project of mine during my student years in 2021. I acknowledge that there might be many shortcomings in this project, so please feel free to provide any straightforward feedback or suggestions you have. Thank you.
